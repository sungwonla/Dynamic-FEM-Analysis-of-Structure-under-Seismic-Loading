# Dynamic-FEM-Analysis-of-Structure-under-Seismic-Loading
FEM code written in MATLAB for analysis and visualization of a structure under seismic loading (ENGN 1300 Final Project)

Main template: driverFinal.m 
Running driverFinal.m will call all of the other scripts in the "Code" folder, and will produce outputs for visualization of the structure (.gif files) as well as plots for the acceleration components and support reaction forces vs. time at the central nodes D and K. The data needed for running driverFinal.m are in the "Data Files" folder and consist of the displacement, velocity, and acceleration components vs. time at the base of the structure (emulating seismic loading).
